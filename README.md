Password Generator

In this project, I have created a Random Password Generator.
It is capable of populating passwords with a character count between 8-128.
You have the option to include any combination of UPPER, lower, special, and numerical characters.

Give it a try!! You won't be dissapointed!!



Step One: Click the Generate Password Button(red).
  A prompt window will open at the top of the page.
