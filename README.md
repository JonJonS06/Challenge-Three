Challenge-Three 

Password Generator

In this project, I have created a Random Password Generator.
It is capable of populating passwords with a character count between 8-128.
You have the option to include any combination of UPPER, lower, special, and numerical characters.

Give it a try!! You won't be dissapointed!!

Step One: Click the Generate Password Button(red).
  A prompt window will open at the top of the page.

Step Two: Enter the preferred length of your password between 8-128, and select "OK".

Step Three: Would you like to use special characters? 
  If yes, then select "OK"
  If no, then select "Cancel"
  
Step Four: Would you like to use numerals?
  If yes, then select "OK"
  If no, then select "Cancel"
  
Step Five: Woul you like to use Uppercase Characters?
  If yes, then select "OK"
  If no, then select "Cancel"
  
Step Six: Would you like to use Lowercase Characters?
  If yes, then select "OK"
  If no, then select "Cancel"
  
Step Seven: Congratulations!! You just created your very on random password based on your personal preferences.
